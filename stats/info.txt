-> Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing data

-> data is a fact or pieces of informations
for example- heights of students

-> Statistics is devided into 2 Stats
1) descriptive stats - it consists organizing and summarizing data ->
        measure of central tendency(mean, median, mode)
        measure of despersion (variance, standard, derivation)
        different types of distribution of data(histogram, pdf, pmf, cdf)
2) infuntial stats - it consists of data measure to conclusion
        with hypothesis testing
        z test
        t -test
        chi square test
        anova
        f test

        to conclusion of sample on population        



typesod data- 1) quantitative - discric n continuous 
            2) qualitative - ordinal n nomminal

    scales of measuremens
1) nomminal scale data
2) ordinal scale data
3) ratio scale data
4) interval scale data



** to visulize outliers we use viscat and box plot

q1 = (25/100) n +1
q2 = (50/100)n +1
q3 = (75/100)n+1

iqr = q3-q1 = 
Upper fence = Q3 + (1.5 * IQR) Lower fence = Q1 â€” (1.5 * IQR)

**** covariance and correlations

spearman rank corerelations - capture liner relations


***probability distribution function

1) prabability mass function - for discreate random variable
        cdf - cummulative distribution fucntion
2) probability density function - for continuous random variable
        pdf is coming from the gradiet of the cdf

types of distribution

1) normal/gaussian distribution -   pdf
        mean=mode=median -> bell curv
        symmetrical curv
        empirical rule
        68% data fall in 1st standard deviation

2) standard normal distribution - pdf
        zscore - find how many away standard deviation from the mean
        
3) log normal distribution - pdf
4) power law distribution - pdf
5) bournoulli distribution - pmf
6) binomial distribution - pmf
7) poisopm distribution - pmf
8) uniform distribution - discreate n continuous - pdf and pmf
9) exponential distribution - pdf
10) vhi square distribution - pdf
11)  F distribution
