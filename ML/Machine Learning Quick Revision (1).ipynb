    "### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a commonly used evaluation metric in regression algorithms. It is derived from the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and provides a more interpretable measure of the average prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how RMSE works:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each data point in the dataset, the regression algorithm predicts a continuous value based on the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicted values are compared to the actual values of the target variable. The difference between the predicted and actual values is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences are squared to ensure positive values and to give more weight to larger errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The squared differences are then averaged across all data points to compute the MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the square root of the MSE is taken to calculate the RMSE. It represents the average magnitude of the prediction errors in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the RMSE can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE = sqrt(MSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE is a popular metric for evaluating regression models because it has the same scale as the target variable, making it easier to interpret. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the regression model to the data, with smaller prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to MSE, RMSE is sensitive to outliers since the squared differences magnify their impact on the overall error. It is commonly used in cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to assess and compare the performance of different regression models."

    "### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is an evaluation metric commonly used in regression algorithms. It provides a measure of the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how MAE works:\n",

    "For each data point in the dataset, the regression algorithm predicts a continuous value based on the input features.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the MAE can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE = (1 / n) * Î£ |y_pred - y_actual|\n",
    "\n",
    "where n is the number of data points, y_pred is the predicted value, and y_actual is the actual value of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE is advantageous because it is simple to understand and interpret. It represents the average absolute deviation of the predictions from the actual values. MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), as it does not square the differences.\n",

    "R-squared is a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of regression models. However, it has limitations. R-squared alone does not provide information about the significance or accuracy of the model's predictions, and it can be misleading when applied to complex or overfit models. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with other evaluation metrics and considerations to assess the overall performance of the model."
